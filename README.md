# IO-PC Plasticity Simulation

Python model of Inferior Olive → Climbing Fiber → Purkinje Cell interactions
demonstrating why spontaneous CF activity ~1 Hz is optimal for stable learning.

Includes:
- IO resonate-and-fire neurons with coupling
- PF inputs (Poisson)
- Purkinje synaptic plasticity with LTD/LTP/null windows
- Visualization and parameter sweeps
